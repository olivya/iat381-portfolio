				<p>Hello! :)​</p>
		
				<p>
					My name is Olivya Striloff, and I'm currently an Interactive 
					Arts + Technology and Business joint major student at Simon
					Fraser University. I reside near Vancouver, BC. I consider
					myself first and foremost an artist, but I love and agree
					with the philosophy that design is "art with a purpose."
				</p>
				
				<p>
					​My hobbies include <a href="personal.html">drawing</a> (of course!), jewelry-making,
					reading, and general surfing of the internet. I love learning
					about other cultures, psychology, as well as many other
					subjects; my Wikipedia-surfing habit has made me a connoisseur
					of many random, but often delightful, factoids. I have an awesome cat named Mucha ("moo•ka"). Fun fact - his namesake is the
					artist who inspired <a href="geisha.html">this project</a>! I am a huge
					fan of Pokémon + Harry Potter, as well as numerous other
					fantasy-based "worlds." I would love to be a <a href="conceptart.html">concept artist</a>
					to help bring these worlds to life, in a setting where a strong
					imagination is valued and encouraged.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					To me, professional artistry in the appropriate form is what
					can set a business apart from its competitors in the best
					possible way. I hope you enjoy the assortment of works I have
					compiled here, and that they give you a better idea of who I
					am as an artist and designer!
