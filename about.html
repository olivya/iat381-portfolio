			<p>Hello! :)​</p>
	
			<p>
				My name is Olivya Striloff, and I'm currently an Interactive Arts + Technology and Business joint major student at Simon Fraser University. I reside near Vancouver, BC. I consider myself first and foremost an artist, but I love and agree with the philosophy that design is "art with a purpose."
			</p>
			
			<p>
				​My hobbies include drawing (of course!), jewelry-making, reading, and general surfing of the internet. I love learning about other cultures, psychology, as well as many other subjects; my Wikipedia-surfing habit has made me a connoisseur of many random, but often delightful, factoids. I am a huge fan of Pokémon + Harry Potter, as well as numerous other fantasy-based "worlds." I think creativity and imagination are incredibly important, but unfortunately find these traits are often undermined or forgotten.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				To me, professional artistry in the appropriate form is what can set a business apart from its competitors in the best possible way. I hope you enjoy the assortment of works I have compiled here, and that they give you a better idea of who I am as an artist and designer!
