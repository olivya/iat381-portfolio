				This personal game project is a collaboration with other students who are similarly looking to gain experience in their respective fields. Being the sole concept artist, it is my job to take the level descriptions provided to me by the developers and create a piece that will illustrate the “look & feel” of these game environments for the animators, 3D modelers,  texture artists, and so on to work from. I have the creative liberty to add any details I feel will make the designs feel more authentic, and am encouraged to do so!
			</p>

				Thus far, the pieces have been of manmade, industrial objects & perspective drawings. Before this project, these subjects were entirely out of my comfort zone - but after a lot of practice and trial & error, I’m very pleased with how my skills have progressed. It became clear from the start how much time and detail goes into making a room look “real” and give off the vibe I picture in my head.

				With the control room (the top image), for example, I had to detail everything from the lighting & shadows to the texture on the walls to achieve the creepy and dirty, yet high-tech, look I was aiming for. So far my work has gotten very positive feedback and I have many more pieces lined up for the near future.The marketing campaign for the game will also be underway soon, and my work will be vital to its success. So far, this project has been a lot of fun - I've loved being so creative and bringing the descriptions handed to me to life via my art!
