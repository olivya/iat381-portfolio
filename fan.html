					<strong>purpose |</strong> I completed this to be used for the loading screen on an in-development mobile application, initially on a volunteer basis, and was later commissioned by the client to expand upon the original piece and provide accompanying graphics with a differently shaped fan (pictured left.)

					<strong>skills + concepts |</strong> ​Animation (especially creating smooth continuity when having to individually draw each frame, in particular with the relatively complex design), communicating with a client throughout the design process.

			For this project, was initially approached by a programmer working on a mobile application to design the loading screen animation, and took the assignment on for the experience. I drew out every frame from scratch and was also responsible for designing the red filigree design.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Upon completion of the first part of the project, I was later approached directly by the original client to expand upon the original animation, and completed this on commission. I was originally instructed to have the corners of the fan disappear past the edge of the screen, but for this project, the client requested I add them back in. Additionally, she asked me to create two accompanying graphics in a slightly different style. These graphics are the first two images on the left above; variations of the final animation are below.
			</p>

			I found the level of continuity required for a smooth animation of this style to be quite challenging and time-consuming, and this skill greatly improved as I progressed with the project. I also gained valuable experience communicating with a client in order to ensure the end product is as they desire, as I am very diligent in checking back with the client each step along the way to ensure things are progressing as they would like.
			</p>
			​
			<p>
			I provided all of the frames as individual image files for the programmer to be able to animate it in the method needed with how he was coding the app, but I animated them myself at various stages along the way as well. This was mainly to test how the continuity was progressing and make adjustments as I went, which I found to be very helpful. The frames are pictured above; I was also requested to design "Loading" text, which can be seen on the first animation below, and provided this as a separate image to be overlaid on the animation if they chose to include it. I've included the animations that I created below:
