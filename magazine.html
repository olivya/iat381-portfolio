			This project was an exercise in utilizing grids and alignment principles to create a professional magazine spread. We were allowed to choose whatever subject matter we desired for our “magazine”, and I opted to go for a topic that allowed me to be creative and have a bit of fun while remaining professional - pop culture and fashion.

			I realized early on in this project how easy it is for a layout to look awkward if there isn’t the right amount of balance, continuity, and “visual weight” on either side of the page, and it was a challenge to get it to look proper and professional at first glance. I really enjoyed trying to create a spread that I could potentially enjoy seeing if I were to come across it in a magazine, and I'm quite pleased with the "look" of the end result. I’d never worked with InDesign before this project, but enjoyed learning how to operate it to achieve affects such as the side of the articles curving along the side of the images so everything was composed neatly and professionally.

			﻿I opted for a cream/pink, gold, and black colour scheme, and selected images that I could arrange to balance the page with a bit of symmetry. I had to use Photoshop to crop the background out of the images so only the figure was present, and also used it to edit the black and white "shadow" images in the background.
